        How to Play<br>

        1. Enter a Username<br>

           - Must be at least 4 letters, maximum 8 letters.<br>
           - Cannot have numbers, spaces, or special characters.<br>
           - Each letter in the username must be alphabetically bigger<br>
             than the previous letter.<br>
    <br>
        2. Guess and select which side you think shall be shown.<br>
           Either Heads or Tails.<br>
    <br>    
        3. Select on 'Start Game!' to start coin flip.<br>
           - Coin shall flip a random number of times between a minimum of 10 OR
             a maximum of 50 times!<br>
           - Number of flips will be shown and the current flip.<br>  
    <br>    
        4. Once the Heads N' Tails game has completed, depending on your guess (Heads or Tails),<br>
           it will either display at least 1 Win or 1 Loss, if playing for the first time.<br>
           And if your guess is correct, of which side is shown by the coin after the flip<br>
           you will get a win. And if the side shown on the coin after the coin flip is different<br>
           from your guess you will get a loss.<br>
    <br>
        5. To reset the game select on 'Reset Game' to play again.<br> 
           You can optionally change your guess from Tails to Heads<br>
