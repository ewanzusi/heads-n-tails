# Heads N' Tails

This repository contains Heads N' Tails a simple JavaScript game created by me (Emmanuel Wanzusi).

The game asks a user to provide a username that meets a specified set of requirements and select either Heads or Tails as a guess. And then they can start playing by selecting Start Game!

Once the game starts a coin will appear on-screen and flip between heads and tails. And if the user guesses the correct final result of the coin flip they will earn a point. If not they will receive a loss.

And to play the game again they can select Reset Game. Optionally before playing again they can make a new guess.

**A Help button will appear after selecting 'Start Game!' for further explanation of game rules.
